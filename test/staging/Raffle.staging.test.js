/*

* Steps to take for staging test on Rinkeby testnet:

   * Get Subscription ID for chainlink VRF.
   * Deploy our contract using the Subscription ID.
   * Register the contract with Chainlink VRF and its Subscription ID.
   * Register the contract with Chainlink Keepers.
   * Run staging tests.
   * 

Subscription ID 15994. Add this to 'helper-hardhat-config' file under Rinkeby network. Make sure to add 'etherscan' API before deploying the contract in order to auto verify.

Fund with Test Link tokens, and add consumer address.

*To deploy on Rinkeby:
yarn hardhat deploy --network rinkeby

*OUTPUT:

deploying "Raffle" (tx: 0x78b588d24042ca19d20ac4283ec64ade9c6c273e4073e6f93b30b3c2b199ace4)...: deployed at 0x6FF5e4880166e6F215738C31358aF301f8551f46 with 1222990 gas
